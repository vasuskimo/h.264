# H.264
This project is a fork of the free x264 codec project http://www.videolan.org/developers/x264.html. Encoding video is a tradeoff between visual quality, encoding speed and file size. This fork is specifically for contexts where encoding speed is not a concern.
The following quick start guide has instructions that help you build the x264 Codec. https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/CompilationGuide/Quick/libx264
